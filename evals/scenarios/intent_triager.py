    # Section 05: Event-Driven Order Pipeline

    ## Problem
    The order processing system needs to transition from synchronous
    request-response to an event-driven pipeline. Orders flow through
    validation, inventory reservation, payment capture, and fulfillment
    stages. Each stage publishes domain events that downstream stages
    consume. Failed stages must trigger compensating transactions.

    ## Requirements
    - REQ-01: Event bus abstraction with at-least-once delivery guarantee
    - REQ-02: Saga pattern for multi-stage order processing with compensation
    - REQ-03: Idempotency keys on all stage handlers to prevent duplicate processing
    - REQ-04: Dead letter queue for events that fail after max retries
    - REQ-05: Distributed tracing correlation IDs across all event handlers
    - REQ-06: Stage-specific retry policies (exponential backoff with jitter)
    - REQ-07: Event schema registry with backward-compatible evolution

    ## Constraints
    - Must integrate with existing OrderRepository and PaymentService
    - Must support both in-process (testing) and distributed (production) event bus
    - Must not break existing synchronous order API during migration
    - Event schemas must be versioned and backward-compatible

    ## Related Files

    ### events/bus.py

    # Proposal Excerpt: Section 05

    Decompose synchronous OrderProcessor into event-driven saga stages.
    Each stage (validate, reserve_inventory, capture_payment, fulfill)
    becomes an independent event handler. Introduce SagaCoordinator to
    manage stage sequencing and compensating transactions.

    Key changes:
    - New events/ module with EventBus, SagaCoordinator, EventStore
    - OrderProcessor decomposed into 4 stage handlers
    - PaymentService wrapped as saga-aware PaymentStage
    - InventoryReservation wrapped as saga-aware ReservationStage
    - New dead_letter_queue.py for failed event handling
    - Migration path: dual-write (sync + events) during transition

    Cross-section impact: Section 08 (monitoring) needs event metrics.
    Section 11 (testing) needs in-process event bus for integration tests.

_ALIGNMENT_EXCERPT = textwrap.dedent("""\
    # Alignment Excerpt: Section 05

    The proposal correctly identifies the saga pattern as the right
    approach for multi-stage order processing. However, the compensation
    logic needs more detail -- especially for the inventory reservation
    rollback case where partial reservations may have been committed.

    Open concerns:
    - Event schema versioning strategy not fully specified
    - Retry policy configuration per-stage vs global unclear
    - Dead letter queue monitoring integration with section 08

        Decide whether this section needs the full bidirectional intent cycle

        or lightweight alignment (existing alignment judge only).

        ## Section Artifacts (read these for grounded assessment)
        - Section spec: `{section_path}`
        - Proposal excerpt: `{proposal_path}`
        - Alignment excerpt: `{alignment_path}`
        - Codemap summary: `{codemap_path}`

        ## Section Characteristics
        - Related files: 6
        - Incoming cross-section notes: 1
        - Mode: brownfield
        - Previous solve attempts: 0
        - Summary: Event-driven order pipeline with saga pattern, multi-stage processing, and compensation logic

        ## Decision Factors

        Consider these factors when choosing intent mode:

        - **Integration breadth**: How many files and modules does this section touch?
        - **Cross-section coupling**: Are there incoming notes or dependencies from other sections?
        - **Environment uncertainty**: Is this greenfield, hybrid, or pure modification?
        - **Failure history**: Have prior attempts at this section failed?
        - **Risk of hidden constraints**: Does the summary suggest architectural complexity?

        Weigh these factors heuristically. Sections that are narrow, well-understood,
        and have no failure history lean lightweight. Sections with broad integration,
        uncertainty, or prior failures lean full.

        ## Output
        Write a JSON signal to: `{triage_signal_path}`
